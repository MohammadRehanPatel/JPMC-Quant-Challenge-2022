Basically this question involved making a strategy for Forex Trading.

We had to make a model that gives the maximum profit while maximising the sharpe ratio.
Training Data was provided in the Online IDE itself. We had to call a function to access it and train the model.

Input was in the form of Forex Pair with conversion rate and the initial amount of money in one currency.
Output was the amount to be bought at each day of another pair while ensuring we had enough currency to buy it.

The model was trained on the data provided and the output was submitted on the platform.
We also had to provide an explanation of the model and the strategy used and submit it as a pdf.
